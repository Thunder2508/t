                    <p>A giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear. 
                        Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim. 
                        Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown). 
                        Pandas have so many fans because they look cute.
                        Pandas are "lazy" — eating and sleeping make their day. 
                        An adult can eat 12–38 kilos of bamboo per day</p>

                    <p> Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902. - The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903</p>
